The TCP/IP Five-Layer Network Model
=====================

The TCP/IP Five-Layer Network Model
-----------

Physical layer  
:Represents the physical devices that interconnect computers

Data link layer  
: Responsible for defining a common way of interpreting these signals so network devices can communicate  
  
The Ethernet standards also define a protocol responsible for getting data to nodes on the same network or link.

Network layer  
: Allows different networks to communicate with each other through devices known as routers  
  
**IP** is the heart of the Internet and most smaller networks around the world.  
  
Transport layer  
: Sorts out which client and server programs are supposed to get that data  
  
Physical layer is the delivery truck and the roads.  
The data link layer is how the delivery trucks get from one intersection to the next over and over.  
The network layer identifies which roads need to be taken to get from addrss A to address B.  
The transport layer ensures that delivery driver knows how to knock on your door to tell you your package has arrived.  
And the application layer is the contents of the package itself.

The Basics of Networking Devices
==============

Cables
-----------

Cables: Connect different devices to each other, allowing data to be transmitted over them

two categories
- Copper
	- most common
	- The most common forms of copper twisted-pair cables used in networking are Cat5, Cat5e, and Cat6 cables.
	- Crosstalk: When an electrical pulse on one wire is accidentally detected on another wire
- Fiber: Contain indibidual optical fibers, which are tiny tubes made out of glass about the width of a human hair

Hubs and Switches
-----------

Hub: A physical layer device that allows for connections from many computers at once  
  
Collision domain: A network segment where only one device can communicate at a time.  
If multiple systems try sending data at the same time, the electrical pulses sent across the cable can interfere with each other.

Routers
-----


Hubs and switches: The primary devices used to connect computers on a single network, usually referred to as a LAN, or local area network  
  
Router: A device that knows how to forward data between independent networks  
  
Border Gateway Protocol(BGP): Routers share data with each other via this protocol, which lets them learn about the most optimal paths to forward traffic
